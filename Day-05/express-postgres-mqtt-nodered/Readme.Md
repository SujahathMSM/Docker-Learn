# Express + PostgreSQL + MQTT + Node-RED Stack

This project is a complete Dockerized stack that includes:

- 🌐 Express.js REST API
- 🐘 PostgreSQL for data persistence
- 📡 MQTT (Eclipse Mosquitto) for messaging
- 🔧 Node-RED for visual automation

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone or Download

Extract the provided zip or clone the repo.

### 2. Run the Stack

Build and start all services with:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

### 3. Access Services

- Express API: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
- Node-RED: [http://localhost:1880](http://localhost:1880)
- MQTT Broker: `mqtt://localhost:1883`

If running on a Raspberry Pi or remote server, replace `localhost` with its IP.

---

## 📡 MQTT Topics

- Subscribed to: `my/topic`
- Use `/publish` POST endpoint to send MQTT messages.

### Example:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/publish \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{ "topic": "my/topic", "message": "Hello MQTT" }'
```

---

## 🗃️ PostgreSQL Table

Created automatically via `db-init.sql`:

```sql
CREATE TABLE messages (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  topic TEXT NOT NULL,
  content TEXT NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

---

## 🧩 Node-RED

- Containerized visual editor
- Can be used to subscribe to MQTT topics or connect to PostgreSQL
- Customize flows under `./nodered` folder
